### Useful Resources
- Accessibility
    - [Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNYkxOF6rcICWx0C9LVWWVqvHlYJyqw7g)
    - [Google's Web Accessibility Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/web-accessibility--ud891) - This course helped me understand accessibility really well. It is a free course that should last about 2 weeks or less. It's a great resource if you want to know more about accessibility.
